    <p>
        I’m sure everyone has their own favorite go-to lasagna recipe, but I'd just like to offer that this really is
        The Best
        Lasagna Ever. Growing up, my mom and her friends used to make it for potlucks and gatherings, and part of its
        appeal is
        that the ingredients used are totally basic; you don't have to hunt down fresh basil or mozzarella cheese or
        handmade
        sausage from an Italian mama in old Napoli. Anyone can make this, anywhere, anytime. Out of all the Italian
        dinner ideas
        in the world, this is one of the easiest.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (14.5-oz.) cans whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6-oz.) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li> Tbsp. dried parsley, divided</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. dried basil</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp. salt
        <li>3 cups low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated (not shredded) parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (1o-oz.) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high
            heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2
            tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer
            for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more
            teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water,
            then cook the lasagna noodles until al dente (not overly cooked). Drain.
        </li>
        <li>

            To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon
            half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of
            mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with
            meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Either freeze, refrigerate for up to 2 days, or bake immediately: 350°F oven until the top is hot and
            bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>

        The cast of characters. See how, um,basic everything is? The recipe even calls for KRAFT parmesan cheese, of all
        things.

        Are you ready? Here we go…
    </p>

    <img src="/images/lasagna//meat.avif" alt="meat">
    <p>
        In a skillet, combine 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1 pound hot breakfast sausage, and 2 cloves minced garlic.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//paw.avif" alt="paw">
    <p>
        Cook until brown.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//cooked1.avif" alt="cooked1">
    <p>
        Then..
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//fat.avif" alt="fat">
    <p>
        You might consider draining off about half the fat. I like to leave some in there, though, because it tastes
        better and because I’m a naughty girl. Just please don’t be a health nut and drain it all, for pete’s sake.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//tomato.avif" alt="tomato">
    <p>
        After that, add two 14.5-oz cans of whole tomatoes, two 6-oz cans of tomato paste…
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//species.avif" alt="species">
    <p>
        2 tablespoons of dried parsley flakes, 2 tablespoons dried basil…
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//salt.avif" alt="salt">
    <p>
        And 1 teaspoon salt.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//cookedmeat1.avif" alt="cookedmeat1">
    <p>
        Mix together thoroughly and simmer, uncovered, about 45 minutes…
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//cookedmeat2.avif" alt="cookedmeat2">
    <p>Stirring occasionally.</p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//pastaboil.avif" alt="pastaboil">
    <p>
        In the meantime, boil a 10-oz package of lasagna noodles. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to the water, as well as 1
        tablespoon
        olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking. Cook the noodles "al dente" so they’ll still have quite a bite to
        them.
        When they’re finished cooking, drain, rinse with cool water, and lay the noodles flat on a sheet of aluminum
        foil. That
        way, they’ll be easier to handle later.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//cheese_egg.avif" alt="cheese_egg">
    <p>
        While the meat mixture and noodles are cooking, mix 3 cups lowfat cottage cheese in a bowl with 2 beaten eggs.
        IMPORTANT: If the thought of cottage cheese makes you want to run out of the house, take heart: you won’t even
        know it’s
        there. Ladd wouldn’t touch cottage cheese with a ten foot pole, yet he loved this lasagna so much…he married me.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//morecheese.avif" alt="morecheese">
    <p>
        To the cottage cheese, add 1/2 cup Kraft Parmesan Cheese…
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//celery.avif" alt="celery">
    <p>
        2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes, and 1 teaspoon salt.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna//mixing.avif" alt="mixing">
    <p>
        Mix together well.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/building.avif" alt="building">
    <p>
        Now, go ahead and build your assembly line: meat mixture, 1 pound sliced mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese
        mixture, and
        cooked lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/lasagna_base.avif" alt="lasagna_base">
    <p>
        Let the assembly begin! Lay four cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of the pan, overlapping as you go.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/mixing.avif" alt="mixing_spread">
    <p>
        Spread half of the cottage cheese mixture evenly over the noodles…
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/more_cheese.avif" alt="more_cheese">
    <p>
        Then lay 1/2 pound of mozzarella cheese slices on top of the cottage cheese mixture. This particular brand of
        cheese was
        cut very thin, so I had to double up the slices to make 1/2 pound. Don’t let this throw you off—some brands are
        cut
        thicker, and would only require a single layer of slices. NOTE: I prefer sliced mozzarella, but you can
        certainly use
        grated mozzarella if necessary.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/meatlove.avif" alt="meat_love">
    <p>
        With the spoon, make a line through the middle of the meat mixture so you’ll distribute it evenly.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/spread_more_meat.avif" alt="meeeeat">
    <p>
        Spread a little less than half of the meat mixture over the mozzarella cheese slices…
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/meat_distribution.avif" alt="meat_everywehere">
    <p>
        Until it’s evenly distributed.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/repeat.avif" alt="more_everything">
    <p>
        Now it’s time to repeat the process! Add another layer of four lasagna noodles…
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <img src="/images/lasagna/mixure_cheese.avif" alt="more_cheese?">
    <p>
        And top with the remaining half of the cottage cheese mixture.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/morecheese2.avif" alt="not_enought">
    <p>
        Then top the cottage cheese mixture with another 1/2 pound of mozzarella.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/repeatmeat.avif" alt="meeeeat">
    <p>And finish with the rest of the meat mixture.</p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/almost_done.avif" alt="beautiful?">
    <p>
        Spread evenly.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/powdercheese.avif" alt="powdercheese">
    <p>
        Now grab that trusty-rusty container of good ol’ Kraft Parmesan Cheese and start sprinklin’!
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lasagna/DONE.avif" alt="FINISH!">
    <p>
        Top with a pretty generous layer.

        Now pop it in a 350-degree oven for 20-30 minutes, until hot and bubbly. (Alternately, you could cover and
        freeze it,
        unbaked, at this point. OR cover and refrigerate, unbaked, for up to two days before baking.)
